# Purpose of app
The purpose of this application is to keep track of daily workout and with the dashboard feature the user will be provided with graphs of their progess.

# Overview of Application
This application is designed to keep track of your daily workouts. The user will create a workout or add a new workout in which they will include the type of either cardio or resistance based upon that selection, the user will then be prompted a series of questions about their workout. With this data, it will be store in the Mongo database. Once the user has data in the database they can see their progess in a graph form on the dashboard page. 

# My exerience 
I enjoyed this application and I could easily see myself and others using it in daily life. One thing that tripped me up was the use of json literal to retrieve the hidden data. With the use of the reduce array method I was able to sum up the total duration to one specific value.
